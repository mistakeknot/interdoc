# Claude Feedback - interdoc
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Context:** Portfolio review for Anthropic job application visibility

## Strategic Assessment

### Why This Project Matters for Anthropic
interdoc demonstrates **deep understanding of Claude Code's architecture**:
- Plugin system mastery
- Subagent coordination patterns
- Practical tooling that makes Claude better

This is **directly relevant** to Anthropic because you're building tools that enhance their product.

### Twitter-Friendly Angle
> "Built a Claude Code plugin that spawns parallel subagents to auto-generate documentation. Watches your git commits and suggests updates. Here's how I designed the subagent coordination..."

## Gaps Identified

### Obvious Gaps
1. **No test suite** - Documentation-driven, but no automated validation
2. **No usage metrics** - How many people use it? Downloads?
3. **No visual demo** - Hard to show a documentation tool in action

### Non-Obvious Gaps
1. **Prompt injection handling not surfaced** - You handle it (interdocumentarian treats content as untrusted) but it's not documented as a safety feature
2. **No comparison to alternatives** - How does interdoc compare to manual docs, other generators?
3. **Subagent coordination patterns not explained** - The parallel spawning is interesting but not documented for others to learn from

## Recommended Open Source Integrations

### High Priority: Prompt Testing

**[Promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo)** - Test prompts systematically
- Test interdocumentarian prompts
- Catch regressions when prompt changes
- Validate output format consistency

Example test:
```yaml
prompts:
  - file://skills/interdoc/SKILL.md
tests:
  - vars:
      directory: "src/components"
    assert:
      - type: contains
        value: "## Purpose"
      - type: is-json
        value: "schema: interdoc.subagent.v1"
```

### Medium Priority: Token Efficiency

Integrate **tldr-swinton** into the interdoc workflow:
- Before spawning subagents, use tldrs to understand codebase structure
- Reduce tokens by 80% in subagent prompts
- Cross-project synergy story

### Low Priority: Study These

**[Mintlify](https://github.com/mintlify/writer)** - AI doc generation
- Study their approach
- Differentiate interdoc (AGENTS.md focus, subagent architecture)

## Action Items

### This Week (High Impact, Low Effort)
- [ ] Add "Safety Considerations" section to README (prompt injection handling)
- [ ] Document subagent coordination pattern for others to learn from
- [ ] Add promptfoo config for basic prompt testing

### This Month (High Impact, Medium Effort)
- [ ] Write blog post: "Parallel Subagents in Claude Code: How interdoc Generates Docs at Scale"
- [ ] Create before/after comparison (manual docs vs interdoc output)
- [ ] Add tldr-swinton integration for token efficiency

### Future (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Usage analytics (opt-in telemetry)
- [ ] Benchmark: time to generate docs for various repo sizes
- [ ] Case study: "interdoc on a 1000-file monorepo"

## Blog Post Outline

**"Parallel Subagents in Claude Code: Lessons from Building interdoc"**

1. **The Problem** - Documenting large codebases is tedious
2. **The Insight** - One agent per directory, run in parallel
3. **The Architecture**
   - How subagent spawning works
   - JSON schema for structured output
   - Sentinel markers for reliable parsing
4. **Safety Considerations**
   - Treating file content as untrusted
   - Handling malicious filenames
   - Output validation
5. **Results** - Token usage, time savings, quality
6. **Lessons Learned** - What worked, what didn't

This is the kind of content Anthropic engineers would appreciate.
